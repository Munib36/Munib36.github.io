    <h1 id="text">A tuna pasta salad is a delightful combination of flavors and textures that makes for a perfect meal. With tender pasta, flaky tuna, and a mix of crunchy vegetables like celery, bell peppers, and red onions, every bite is refreshing and satisfying. The creamy dressing, often made with mayonnaise or a light vinaigrette, adds a tangy and savory element that ties everything together. It's a versatile dish that can be enjoyed cold, making it ideal for hot summer days or as a quick, healthy lunch. Packed with protein and flavor, a tuna pasta salad is both nutritious and incredibly delicious.</h1>
